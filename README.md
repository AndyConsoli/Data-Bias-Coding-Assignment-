Hypothesis: I believe that the informal pieces of content will bring the result of more toxic outcomes. This hypothesis is based on my own personal experience with toxicity of content on the internet where longer/formal types of content are typically less offensive than informal pieces of content like tweets on Twitter or comments on Instagram. I am predicting that the scores of informal content will be above .5 in the toxicity range while formal pieces will be under the .5 threshold which would make these results as non toxic. I will also be checking anti-male and anti-female comments on informal/formal content and I predict that anti-female comments will result in more toxic outcomes than anti-male content.
